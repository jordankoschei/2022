            <p>Most of us live in a constant state of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_partial_attention">Continuous Partial Attention</a>.
Rather than focusing on one thing at a time, our attention is constantly scattered among a variety of sources, each of which
only has part of our focus.</p>

<p>We’re at work, but we’re also keeping tabs on a text chain.</p>

<p>We’re reading a book, but we’re also checking Twitter or Instagram every two paragraphs.</p>

<p>We’re in a conversation, but our eyes keep flicking up to the TV on in the background.</p>

<p>Maintaining a state of Continuous Partial Attention is rarely a choice, but our current media environment seems specially designed
to keep us in that state. We keep our phones in our pockets like a totem, our hands and minds constantly reaching for them as soon
as we feel the mildest itch of boredom.</p>

<p>We can no longer bear to be doing nothing. We can’t just stand in line, waiting, without checking some other source of information.
We’ve sacrificed solitude — not even true solitude, but just being alone with our thoughts — at the altar of being Always On.</p>

<p>Checking our feeds makes us feel like we’re in control. Really, they’re just making us scattered and docile.</p>

<p>We need boredom. We need to give our minds the chance to do one thing at a time.
<a href="https://qz.com/1020976/the-scientific-link-between-boredom-and-creativity/">Boredom is a prerequisite for creativity.</a>
<a href="http://www.apa.org/research/action/multitask.aspx">Multitasking is a myth.</a></p>

<p>Ironically, it’s this same media environment that’s connected to the massive upswing in jobs that are considered “knowledge work.” And knowledge
work requires <em>more</em> dedicated attention than other jobs. It’s hard to write, or code, or design without reaching a state of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a>. And yet the things
we’re writing, coding, or designing seem best suited to preventing others from reaching the same.</p>

<p>A professor of mine used to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can’t use a hammer without getting a callous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What’s the callous our current tools are giving us?</p>

<p>###All this is to say:###</p>

<p>I’m tired of never being fully present. This week, I’m issuing myself a challenge: only do one thing at a time.</p>

<p>If I’m eating, I want to be eating — not reading or watching <em>Parks and Rec</em> or doing something else at the same time.</p>

<p>If I’m working, I don’t want Twitter on in the background. Or Slack. Or email.</p>

<p>If I’m watching TV, I don’t want to be on my phone as well.</p>

<p>That’s my plan. Feel free to join me.</p>
