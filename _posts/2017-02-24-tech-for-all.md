> Anyone with an internet connection and enough motivation can learn how to design and program the next big thing, no degree required. Tech is no longer just for engineers and programmers. It's for the retiree looking for a second career, and the 12-year-old who decides she wants to make her own video game. It's for the college student who wants to boost his resum√©, and the immigrant looking to get plugged in to their new community. Tech is for everyone.

This is the first entry in a newspaper column I'll be curating in conjunction with the Poughkeepsie Journal and the Hudson Valley Tech Meetup. The monthly column will be written by members of the Hudson Valley tech community, and will cover design, technology, and their effects on the local economy and culture.

Stay tuned.
