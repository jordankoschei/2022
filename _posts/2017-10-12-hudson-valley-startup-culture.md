> A few weeks ago, I launched one attempt to help bring us closer together: the Hudson Valley Talentbase (hvtalentbase.com). The premise is simple — anyone in the Hudson Valley can sign up, create a profile and start uploading creative projects they've been working on. It doesn't have to be tech-related — it's for your writing project, your art, your brewing, your baking, your app, your website, your music, your sewing and anything else you might be working on. People can search through a list of people and projects and see the interesting work going on nearby. Soon there will be collaboration features and collaborator matchmaking — if you're a filmmaker in New Paltz looking for music, and there's a composer in Kingston who's up for collaborating, it will help pair you up so your project can become a reality.
