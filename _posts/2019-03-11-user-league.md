I was interviewed for User League, a new online publication from [Dave Martin](https://twitter.com/itsdavemartin), principal designer at [Automattic](https://automattic.com/).

This quote sums up what I believe about design:

> I like to think of design as a form of hospitality — we’re creating digital environments in which our users will live for a time. Those environments should make our users feel comfortable and confident, and enable them to do things they couldn’t otherwise do. **A good product gives the user superpowers** without drawing too much attention to itself. It’s better to leave the user thinking, “Hey, I’m awesome” than “Hey, that product’s awesome.”

Thanks, Dave! Head over to User League to read the [full interview](https://userleague.com/jordan-koschei/).
