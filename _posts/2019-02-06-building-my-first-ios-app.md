  No, I never finished or released this app, though I did get it working to the point where I was proud of it. It would've been cool, but honestly I was never passionate enough about it to take it any further, and apps like <a href="https://portal.app/" target="_blank">Portal</a> are doing the same thing to a higher degree of excellence.

**TL;DR** — I'm building an iPhone app called Interlude, using the knowledge of Swift I've gained by working at Dwell.
It's a small project that will give me the chance to build something start-to-finish, rather than just editing an existing
codebase, so I'll learn more about the overall native development ecosystem.

## How I Learn

I've always learned new languages and frameworks by necessity, diving into existing codebases to make
tweaks and eventually gaining the understanding to build more robust features.

I learned PHP by working on WordPress sites (who didn't?).

I learned Rails by working on Agrilyst and Dwell.

I learned React and React Native by implementing more complex features at Agrilyst.

Now, at Dwell, I've had a chance to work with Swift and develop a native app.

## Languages vs. Ecosystems

True understanding doesn't come from editing existing code, it comes from starting from scratch and seeing a whole project
through. Being able to play around in someone else's codebase is one thing; being able to start something new is another.

The challenge with code isn't usually the code itself; it's understanding the ecosystem and conventions well enough to build
something. Just understanding Ruby won't let you build a Rails app — you have to know about installing gems, and spinning up a
local server, and doing all the tangential things that allow you to start coding.

I don't want to just be able to jump into an existing Swift project and make changes; I want to be able to start from
scratch and create something new.

## Starting from Scratch

With that in mind, I've started building Interlude, an unguided meditation timer for iPhone.

The basic premise is this: I want to make more space in my life to pray and meditate, and I like doing so with pleasant background
ambience. I _don't_ want a British monk talking in my ear, or a soft voice explaining how to breathe more deeply. Apps like
Headspace and Calm are focused on those guided meditations, and their unguided modes are afterthoughts.

Interlude is _just_ the unguided mode. You can pick a scene — forest, beach, mountaintop, etc. — and listen to high-quality
audio for a set amount of time. There are only three features: a meditation mode, a breathing mode, and a profile screen from which
you can track your stats.

It's as close to a "hello world" app as I can reasonably put in the app store.
