> I've known since I was a kid that I wanted to end up living in the Hudson Valley. Most of the high-profile jobs in the tech sector are located in places like San Francisco and New York, but I didn't want to put my community life on hold while I built a career elsewhere. Thanks to remote work, I've been able to cultivate a career from the place that I love without sacrificing either my work or my interests.
