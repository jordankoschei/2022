I've been reading the book _[Radical Technologies: The Design of Everyday Life](https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Technologies-Design-Everyday-Life/dp/178478043X/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1536586259&sr=1-1)_ by Adam Greenfield, and I thought this quote insightful, on how smartphones shape our lives:

> It's easy, too easy, to depict the networked subject as being isolated, in contact with others only at the membrane that divides them. But if anything, the overriding quality of our era is porosity. Far from affording any kind of psychic sanctuary, the walls we mortar around ourselves turn out to be as penetrable a barrier as any other. Work invades our personal time, private leaks into public, the intimate is trivially shared, and the concerns of the wider world seep into what ought to be a space for recuperation and recovery. Above all, horror finds us wherever we are.

I started reading the book a while back, but life got in the way and I'm finally picking it up again. It's a breakdown of how nine different technologies are reshaping the world in invisible ways, from how the Internet of Things promotes a worldview of "unreconstructed logical positivism" (the belief that everything can be perfectly measured, and thus perfectly controlled, and human bias can be eliminated) to how smartphones make us nodes in a network, rather than discrete individuals.

Most books in this genre are either too optimistic or too pessimistic for my taste, but this one is neither technophilic or technophobic. Also unlike most books in the genre, it doesn't read like a BuzzFeed article ("You won't believe how these 9 technologies will make your life awesome!!!")... it feels more like something Marshall McLuhan would write.

All-in-all, it's been a lot to chew on, and I'm left with the feeling that it's an important read. It's certainly changing my understanding of the technologies that are coming down the pike. I'm a particular fan of the chapter titles, which sum up the thesis of each chapter and contain gems like:

2. The internet of things: A planetary mesh of perception and response
3. Digital fabrication: Towards a political economy of matter
4. Automation: The annihilation of work

With a last name like Greenfield, it's no wonder the author writes about high technology.
