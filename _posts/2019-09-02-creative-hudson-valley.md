I've started a publication called [**Creative Hudson Valley**](https://creativehudsonvalley.com) that features interviews with interesting people doing interesting work in the Hudson Valley.

In the words of the site's About page:

> Creative Hudson Valley is an online publication featuring interviews with creative people of all stripes, living and working in the Hudson Valley.
>
> It’s a love letter to the incredible dynamism of the Hudson Valley creative scene. We’ll celebrate artists and designers, filmmakers and musicians, chefs and brewers, entrepreneurs and community leaders. We’ll cover people doing the best work of their lives in Ulster, Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, and beyond. We’ll feature creatives at every level of recognition, from big names to local icons to the artisan next door.
