I've spent the last two weeks in San Francisco, onboarding at [Spoke](https://askspoke.com),
where I've joined as Senior Product Designer.

Spoke is an AI-powered ticketing and knowledge management tool for IT, HR, and any other team
you can think of. Rather than directing your requests to a person, it figures out if it already
knows the answer and surfaces the relevant knowledge. It's impressively smart, and getting
moreso all the time.

I'll be continuing to work remotely from the Hudson Valley, traveling to the SF office a few
times a year. It's not a bad place to spend some time:
