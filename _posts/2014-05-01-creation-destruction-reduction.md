**Creation** is the process by which we bring something new into existence. It may be derivative, it may even be a ripoff, but it’s still something new.

**Destruction** is the process by which we tear down something that already exists.

**Reduction** is the process by which we remove extraneous elements. While it often looks like destruction, it’s actually a critical part of the creation process. Pure, unfettered creation — that is, creation without editing — usually results in a tangled, bloated mess. Only by carving away at that mess do we create something focused.

As Blaise Pascal famously wrote: “I have made this longer than usual because I have not had time to make it shorter.”

Creation is more than just an additive process; skillful reduction is essential to the refinement of one’s work. Brevity is the soul of wit, and focus is the soul of great design.
