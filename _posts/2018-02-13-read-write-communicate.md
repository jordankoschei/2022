title: 'Read, Write, Communicate'

I've always preferred to use different devices for production and consumption: I like to use the computer to create things and do work, and my tablet/phone to consume content (read articles, watch Netflix, listen to podcasts, etc).

I don't like to muddle those two modes — it's too easy to get sidetracked. If I use the same screen for production and consumption, it's far too easy to start working and find myself on YouTube, or reading Hacker News.

Recently, I decided to divide up those tasks further. I don't want to use my phone for consumption anymore, but just for communication. As I wrote previously, I want to embrace boredom, stay aware of my surroundings, and not feel compelled to spend every moment consuming information.

With that in mind, here's the new division of labor between my devices:

- **Macbook Pro** — Writing, design, code, etc. Anything industrial-grade related to work.
- **iPhone** — Communication. I removed Tweetbot and Instapaper, and reinstalled Moment to remind me if I've spent more than 15 minutes using the phone for anything besides its intended purpose.
- **iPad Pro** — Consumption. I've got Tweetbot, Reeder, and Instapaper installed (plus the usual video services). If I want to read, I'll do it here.

It's working well so far, but it's only been a few days. Keeping the division sharp between those modes of thinking feels cleaner, somehow, than using every device for every purpose.
