title: A Mysterious (and Funny) Robo-Call

A few minutes ago, I got a call from a number I didn’t recognize.

**Me:** Hello?

**Phone:** Hello! I’m calling on behalf of [political organization] to talk about the 2014 elections. I’m glad I caught you today.

**Me:** Um…

**Phone:** I was wondering if you’d be interested in making a donation of `subtle computer noise` thirty-five or fifty dollars.

At this point, I realized what was going on. The tone of voice shifted immediately before the phrase “thirty-five dollars,” as if the recording had different presets depending on the demographic or age data associated with the phone. I decided to have some fun.

**Me:** Hang on. You’re a computer, right?

**Phone:** `pause` Haha, I don’t sound that bad, do I?

**Me:** Um…

**Phone:** As I was saying, your contribution is very important…

**Me:** I only ask because the computerized phone systems are getting pretty sophisticated, and it’s kind of hard to tell.

**Phone:** `pause` I know it’s a lot to ask…

**Me:** If you aren’t a computer, say the word “banana.”

**Phone:** I’m sorry, sir, is this a bad time?

**Me:** Just say the word “banana” and I’ll stay on the line.

**Phone:** Your contribution is very important…

**Me:** Banana?

**Phone:** Can I write you down for a thirty-five dollar contribution?

At this point, I’m scrambling to find someone nearby so I can put this on speakerphone and have some fun. Before I can, though, the robot starts its goodbye sequence and wishes me a good day.

There are no witnesses. If it weren’t for [this](http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/12/10/meet-the-robot-telemarketer-who-denies-shes-a-robot/), I might not have believed it.

And now, back to our regularly scheduled programming.
