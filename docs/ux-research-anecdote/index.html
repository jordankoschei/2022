            <p>“Can you make sure they add sounds to the next version?”</p>

<p>I’m standing in an aisle of a Wal-Mart in suburban Florida, scrambling to open up my
notebook as the rest of my team walks out the door onto the bus. I’m still not entirely
sure what’s going on, but the guy in front of me looks frustrated, so I’m pretty sure
he’s about to tell me something valuable.</p>

<p>It’s the end of 2015; I’m doing UX work at a small agency, mostly for Fortune 500s who are trying
to make their internal tools a little less horrible to use. On this project, I’m traveling
around the country with a small team, shadowing merchandisers from a brand-name consumer-goods company
as they drive to different stores and stock the shelves with their product. It’s just me, my project manager,
and three consultants from a gigantic consulting company.</p>

<p>We’ve just finished shadowing this particular merchandiser and are getting ready to leave for our next
stop. I’m the last one out of the aisle, and the merchandiser we’ve been observing pulls me aside.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure if you can do anything about this, but I’m having an issue with our new app, and I think other
people have been having an issue too.”</p>

<p>I offer to listen, but I don’t make any promises. That’s the job, and I don’t even know if the project will even go beyond the research
phase.</p>

<p>He goes on to tell me that the company had previously used dedicated inventory devices — hardware with actual, physical buttons — and replaced
them with iPads with a custom inventory app.</p>

<p>“The old devices used to click when you’d press a button,” he says. Now, it’s impossible to tell. “There’s no click
or anything when you tap the screen. It’s too easy to miss the button, or hit it too many times. I’ll try to order
two cases of something, but accidentally order 22.”</p>

<p>I’m trying to write while listening — this is the most valuable feedback I’ve heard all day. Sometimes people are reluctant
to share what they really think when being shadowed, because they feel like corporate is watching them.</p>

<p>“The app was supposed to help us work faster, but instead it slows us down. I have to double-check the screen every time I do something,
to make sure I’m not double-ordering. If it just made a clicking noise when I pressed a button, I wouldn’t have to do that.”</p>

<p>I thanked him for his feedback, and told him I’d do what I could, but again — no promises. He said thanks, and looked like he was happy
to have unburdened himself. It’s strange how much stress can accumulate from these tiny, inconsequential-seeming design decisions. Somebody
in an office a thousand miles away decided an app didn’t need sound effects; now a ground-level employee finds that his job is a little harder
than it was before.</p>

<p>It’s been years since I worked on enterprise software, or at an agency. With some distance, I’m reminded of three design truths:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Everything’s easier when your customer is also your user. With business software, it’s often the opposite — the person buying the software
will likely never use the software, leading to misaligned incentives and a poorer product.</li>
  <li>Research is the easist thing to cut out of the design process, but without it, design is based on our all-too-fallible instincts. Without talking
to actual users, I doubt I would ever consider the importance of sound effects to an inventory app. Whoever designed that app probably had the best
intentions, but lacked the time or budget or support to do user research. It happens much too often.</li>
  <li>The latest and greatest technology is sometimes a step back for usability. iPads sound great when compared to old-school push-button hardware, but in reality,
they present a lot of extra challenges for users who are moving fast and not giving 100% attention to the screen.</li>
</ol>

<p>This wound up being the last thing I did on this project — the company decided to push it back, and my involvement ended with the research phase. I left agency life
soon after to join a startup, which presents a very different set of challenges than working with giant enterprises. I think of this story occasionally, though, whenever
I think about the value of user research.</p>
