<p>I’ve always had a hard time finding a task management system that clicks for me. I’ve tried plenty of them — OmniFocus, Things, 2Do, Todoist, good old pen-and-paper. Each of them has pros and cons.</p>

<p>My needs aren’t wildly complex, and I’m not a productivity nerd the way some people are. What I look for in a task manager is simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nested projects/tasks, so not everything lives on the same level.</li>
  <li>The ability to create a checklist without a due date, for tracking things like groceries and my reading list.</li>
  <li>An aesthetically-pleasing interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s the third one that’s tripped me up the most. A task manager plays such a prominent role in one’s life — I don’t want to dread opening it up.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the task managers that have the features I need tend to be ugly, and the task managers that are beautiful tend to lack the features I need.</p>

<p>I was previously using <strong>2Do</strong>, which had everything I needed functionally, but it was unattractive and lacking in the UX department. It was also developed by a single person (as far as I could tell), so what happens if the developer gets hit by a bus? Or stops developing new features? It made me antsy.</p>

<p><strong>OmniFocus 2</strong> was ugly as well, and my brief couple of hours with Todoist were a wildly frustrating experience — their recent redesign still looks like it was optimized for a narrower and lower-resolution screen than my MacBook Pro, and adding new projects felt like pulling teeth.</p>

<p>Then, last week, <strong><a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things 3</a></strong> was released. My first task manager was Things 2, whose lack of nesting wound up being a dealbreaker, but the trailer for Things 3 was so pretty I decided to try it anyway.</p>

<p>It doesn’t have all the features I need, but it’s so pleasant to use that I decided to try shoehorning my process into its constraints anyway. Then I decided I enjoyed it, so I retooled my process to match Things 3’s proficiencies.</p>

<p>My grocery list is now a single task with a nested checklist. I’ve flattened some of my nested projects, and ditched some things I wasn’t really working on. And, thanks to Headings, some of my lists have actually gotten <em>more</em> organized since losing nested projects.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/things3-headings.png" alt="My reading list in Things 3" /></p>

<p>My one big frustration is the fact that Things 3 doesn’t support repeating tasks inside of projects, so my weekly “Compile newsletter” task doesn’t fit inside the Random Access Newsletter project. But the developers’ very-responsive Twitter account assures me this is coming soon.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/jordankoschei">@jordankoschei</a> We do have checklists inside to-dos now, and repeating to-dos in projects are coming.</p>&mdash; Things (@culturedcode) <a href="https://twitter.com/culturedcode/status/866328867325259776">May 21, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>All this brings me to the larger point I’ve been thinking about lately: <strong>your task management system can’t save you</strong>.</p>

<p>There’s something magical about that New Management App smell. Inputting your information into a new system, deciding you’re going to get your life in order, deciding that <em>this one will actually work, I’ll stick with it this time</em>. Like somehow your enhanced productivity will make everything better. I always feel like Liz Lemon after her trip to the Container Store, saying “I’m going to become wonderful!”</p>

<p>But productivity is just a tool. Efficiency and organization are meaningless unless they serve meaningful goals, and even the goals that feel meaningful don’t guarantee true satisfaction.</p>

<p>It’s easy to get caught up in the endorphin rush of feeling like our lives are under control. But the bigger question remains: <em>Under control for what?</em></p>

<p>And that’s a question we each have to wrestle with for ourselves.</p>
