        <div class="prose-body">
            <p>As I get older, I’ve come to value handwriting more and more.</p>

<p>When I was a kid, I never understood why we had to handwrite everything in school, often in (gasp) cursive. I preferred the speed and precision of typing, especially as someone who had terrible handwriting. I felt the same way throughout my academic career, especially when it was validated in college by the expectation that everything would be type.</p>

<p>Even in college I noticed that my retention was lower when I typed. I ignored the signs then, because I still preferred typing to hand cramps, but now there’s research backing up the idea that typed notes are less effective than handwritten ones. As the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> asked: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/can-handwriting-make-you-smarter-1459784659">Can handwriting make you smarter?</a></p>

<p>Similarly, my retention is lower when reading a book on a Kindle rather than on paper. Anecdotal, I know, but I suspect the data would bear this out.</p>

<p><em>[begin unscientific conjecture]</em></p>

<p>My guess about why paper and handwriting beats screens and typing? The human brain has been tuned over millions of years to register geographic data as important. Where’s the best source of food? Where’s good shelter? Where’s that den of vicious animals to avoid?</p>

<p>Screens don’t have their own geography — no matter what you’re reading on a screen, it’s still the same screen. Your brain has less reason to automatically memorize it. There’s no geographic data like there is with the page. Similarly, handwriting has a spatial component that typing does not — the texture and smell of the page, and the feel of the pen as it glides over the paper, make a difference.</p>

<p><em>[end of unscientific conjecture]</em></p>

<p>All this is to say: I want to be someone who writes things out longhand more than I do. I want to carry a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book">commonplace book</a> around with me to record quotes and notes. I want to draft essays on paper and then transfer them into my computer. I want to keep a journal that doesn’t rely on a hard drive. I want the notes I put in the margins of books to be comprehensible by future generations.</p>

<p>What’s stopping me? Mostly my handwriting — it’s atrocious. I often can’t read things I wrote a few hours earlier.</p>

<p>I wish I’d spent more time working on my handwriting in school. It’s possible to practice and change your handwriting, but it’s hard, and you have to work through the decades of muscle memory (and hand cramps).</p>

<p>Also, there’s the downside of having a notebook that looks like it was last used by a serial killer. Row after row of capital A, lowercase A, capital B, lowercase B. I’m just inches away from “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.”</p>

<p>But it’s <a href="http://austinkleon.com/2012/05/23/how-to-improve-your-handwriting/">worth the effort</a>.</p>
