            <p>Design is a form of hospitality.</p>

<p>Done well, design should be welcoming. It should invite users into the
world it creates, making them feel at home. This is true for websites,
apps, books, posters, album covers — you name it.</p>

<p>Most design is about reducing friction: reducing the friction to find
information, to connect with friends, to share your thoughts, to consume
more content. Reducing friction is a form of hospitality.</p>

<p>Not all design is meant to reduce friction, of course. If you’re designing
an interface for a missile defense system, you probably want to <em>increase</em>
the friction around hitting the big red button. Making people feel comfortable —
giving them appropriate guardrails that reduce the fear of making mistakes —
is a form of hospitality.</p>

<p>Making users feel like they know what they’re doing is a form of hospitality.</p>

<p>Giving users a pleasant place to spend their time is a form of hospitality.</p>

<p>Making tasks easier so users can get back to their real lives — their homes
and hobbies and families — is a form of hospitality.</p>

<p>Creating mechanisms that deliberately addict your users is not hospitable.</p>

<p>Luring your users into behaviors for the sole purpose of generating data that you
sell to third parties is not hospitable.</p>

<p>Purposely obfuscating the way your product makes money is not hospitable. Purposely
obfuscating the meaning of your privacy policy is not hospitable.</p>

<p>Transparently providing a service and charging for it is hospitable.</p>

<p>This is why hotels are hospitable in a way that casinos are not.</p>

<p>Let’s seek to design hotels, not casinos.</p>
