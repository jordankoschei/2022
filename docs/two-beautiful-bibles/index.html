<p>Having been a Christian for years, I own several Bibles. I appreciate that this is a luxury uncommon
in the history of the faith; for a long time, it was rare to own a single Bible, and for longer than
that it was rare to access to Scripture aside from hearing it read aloud. And there are still places
on earth where owning a Bible can get you thrown in jail or worse.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Some of the Bibles I own serve different purposes. I have a single-column Bible that I like to use
for day-to-day reading, since multiple columns makes it feel more like a book for reference and less
like a book for reading. I own an <a href="https://www.crossway.org/bibles/esv-study-bible-none-case/">ESV Study Bible</a> replete with maps and charts and commentary that I use
for digging into Scripture — less for reading than for studying.</p>

<p>And I own two Bibles for the sheer beauty of them.</p>

<p>The one that inspired me to write this post I got just the other day: The <a href="https://www.crossway.org/bibles/esv-story-of-redemption-bible-case/">Story of Redemption Bible</a>,
illustrated by Peter Voth. I know <a href="https://dribbble.com/petervoth">Peter’s work</a> from Dribbble, and when I saw his illustrations, I knew
I had to own a copy. It’s got lovely gold accents, friendly and readable typography, and illustrations
that look like etchings.</p>

<p>On one of his <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/5775084-Greg-Gilbert-on-the-new-ESV-Story-of-Redemption-Bible">Dribbble posts</a>, Peter mentions that the design team wanted it to feel like a single-volume
<em>Lord of the Rings</em>. Between the fold-out chronology in the back, and the illustrated pendants that head
each book, I think they hit their mark.</p>

<p>The second Bible isn’t really a Bible at all — it’s an anthology of <a href="http://fourholygospels.makotofujimura.com/">the four Gospels</a>. It’s illuminated by
Makoto Fujimura, one of my favorite artists. He’s an abstract expressionist, and he’s known for incorporating ground-up gemstones into his work to give it a luminescent quality.</p>

<p>Because of how large the Fujimura book is, it’s not really for reading — it’s more to keep at a lectern,
or (in my case) to keep near my desk to look at and smile occasionally.</p>

<p>I had the chance to see his Four Gospels frontispieces in-person at the Dillon Gallery in New York City;
they were massive, and because of the materials he uses, they look different from different angles. I love
this Bible, but unfortunately a print can’t capture the feeling of the originals.</p>

<p>The text is illuminated by illustrations painted directly onto the Scripture by Fujimura.</p>

<p>The Scriptures make it clear that God cares about beauty; as creatures made in His image, we’re wired to care
about it too. The Church hasn’t always made aesthetics a priority — we’re not in the era of
cathedrals and Michaelangelo and Bach anymore — but it’s heartening to see projects like these that pursue
excellence in the presentation of God’s Word.</p>
