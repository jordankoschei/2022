<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> — I’m building an iPhone app called Interlude, using the knowledge of Swift I’ve gained by working at Dwell.
It’s a small project that will give me the chance to build something start-to-finish, rather than just editing an existing
codebase, so I’ll learn more about the overall native development ecosystem.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="how-i-learn">How I Learn</h2>

<p>I’ve always learned new languages and frameworks by necessity, diving into existing codebases to make
tweaks and eventually gaining the understanding to build more robust features.</p>

<p>I learned PHP by working on WordPress sites (who didn’t?).</p>

<p>I learned Rails by working on Agrilyst and Dwell.</p>

<p>I learned React and React Native by implementing more complex features at Agrilyst.</p>

<p>Now, at Dwell, I’ve had a chance to work with Swift and develop a native app.</p>

<h2 id="languages-vs-ecosystems">Languages vs. Ecosystems</h2>

<p>True understanding doesn’t come from editing existing code, it comes from starting from scratch and seeing a whole project
through. Being able to play around in someone else’s codebase is one thing; being able to start something new is another.</p>

<p>The challenge with code isn’t usually the code itself; it’s understanding the ecosystem and conventions well enough to build
something. Just understanding Ruby won’t let you build a Rails app — you have to know about installing gems, and spinning up a
local server, and doing all the tangential things that allow you to start coding.</p>

<p>I don’t want to just be able to jump into an existing Swift project and make changes; I want to be able to start from
scratch and create something new.</p>

<h2 id="starting-from-scratch">Starting from Scratch</h2>

<p>With that in mind, I’ve started building Interlude, an unguided meditation timer for iPhone.</p>

<p>The basic premise is this: I want to make more space in my life to pray and meditate, and I like doing so with pleasant background
ambience. I <em>don’t</em> want a British monk talking in my ear, or a soft voice explaining how to breathe more deeply. Apps like
Headspace and Calm are focused on those guided meditations, and their unguided modes are afterthoughts.</p>

<p>Interlude is <em>just</em> the unguided mode. You can pick a scene — forest, beach, mountaintop, etc. — and listen to high-quality
audio for a set amount of time. There are only three features: a meditation mode, a breathing mode, and a profile screen from which
you can track your stats.</p>

<p>It’s as close to a “hello world” app as I can reasonably put in the app store.</p>
