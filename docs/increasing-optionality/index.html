        <p>One heuristic I find useful for making decisions is: <em>will this increase or decrease my optionality?</em></p>

<p>In other words, will a given decision open up the range of future options available to me?</p>

<p>I have a friend who lived, for several years, off of 50% of his salary. This gave him several options that most of us don’t have:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Each year he worked gave him enough money in the bank to spend a year <em>not</em> working, while maintaining the same quality of life. (Or, in his case, working entirely on personal projects without drawing a salary).</li>
  <li>He could take a much lower-paying job without having to adjust his lifestyle. If he found a job he was passionate about that paid only half his current salary, he could take it without downsizing his life.</li>
</ol>

<p>Conversely, if someone is living off 100% of their salary, their options for other jobs are constrained — they either need to find work with equal or higher salary, or they need to downsize.</p>

<p>Debt is the prime example of a constraint on financial choices. If I take out a loan, it may increase my short-term optionality (I have more immediate funds to work with), but decrease my long-term optionality (a larger chunk of my income is now devoted to repaying debt)</p>

<p>Money is an easy example, but there are plenty of others:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If I have a pet, will it constrain my ability to travel?</li>
  <li>If I take on volunteer commitments, will it constrain my ability to spend time working on a side project?</li>
  <li>If I take a trip and plan out what I’m doing every hour, will it hamper my ability to make choices in-the-moment and do what seems interesting?</li>
</ul>

<p>I suppose this is all related to opportunity cost — time and resources are finite, so we can’t do one thing without reducing our bandwidth to do other things. Optionality is about understanding your priorities.</p>

<p>It strikes me that life is largely built around choosing where we’re comfortable reducing our available options, in order to open up more options.</p>

<p>I choose to work a full-time job because, even though it reduces my available time by 40 hours a week, it increases my available resources to spend on the other 128 hours.</p>

<p>I choose to work on my side projects because I value them more than I value whatever diversions I could spend that time doing.</p>

<p>At any branch in the path, though, I still find it useful to ask myself: <em>will this increase or decrease my range of available options?</em></p>
