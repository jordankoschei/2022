This website has been lovingly hand-coded in HTML and CSS. It's powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static-site generator written in Ruby,
which gives it the advantages of a CMS without the downsides of dynamic rendering.

There's a little bit of JavaScript. Some of the more repetitive JS was generated by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) based on my prompts, because how cool is that?

I started writing the styles in pure CSS before eventually adopting some [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) sugar (namely nesting). I liked the idea of going
fully old-school and writing everything by hand, but quickly remembered why nobody does that anymore.

The font is [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora).

Colors were adapted from the [Tailwind CSS default palette](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#default-color-palette), though the site itself doesn't use Tailwind. I hate choosing colors
so it was nice to use an existing palette as a jumping-off point.

The site is hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
