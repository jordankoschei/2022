    <p>I was a Design Manager and then a Principal Product Designer at Okta, where I designed components, shipped production code, and developed processes and tools used across the company.</p>
    <p>I can talk about this portion of my work at Okta because Odyssey is open-source. You can see the code on <a href="https://github.com/okta/odyssey">GitHub</a> and live examples on <a href="https://odyssey-storybook.okta.design/">Storybook</a>.</p>
    <p>For a more visual-centric look at my work, see my <a href="{% link work/connecthv.md %}">ConnectHV case study</a>.</p>

I joined Okta as a design manager following the acquisition of my previous company, <a href="{% link work/spoke.md %}">Spoke</a>, in 2021.
