    <p>I was a Design Manager and then a Principal Product Designer at Okta, where I designed components, shipped production code, and developed processes and tools used across the company.</p>
    <p>I can talk about this portion of my work at Okta because Odyssey is open-source. You can see the code on <a href="https://github.com/okta/odyssey">GitHub</a> and live examples on <a href="https://odyssey-storybook.okta.design/">Storybook</a>.</p>

I joined Okta as a design manager following the acquisition of my previous company, <a href="{% link work/spoke.md %}">Spoke</a>, in 2021.

My initial role was to integrate Spoke into Okta’s existing architecture, collaborating closely with the Okta design team to unify both platforms into a seamless experience.

However, after an early conversation with the Chief Design Officer, he suggested I might be a strong fit for the Design Systems team. My blend of design and technical expertise, along with my ability to bridge cross-functional communication, positioned me well to help evolve the nascent Odyssey Design System into Okta’s system-of-record for admin experiences.

During my tenure on Odyssey, I proposed foundational architectural changes and played a key role in transforming it from an under-leveraged concept of a system into a cornerstone of Okta’s design and front-end toolchain.

This wasn’t just about designing in Figma and shipping production-ready code — it also required rethinking processes to enhance collaboration, streamline development, encourage contributions, and drive adoption.

## The challenge

When I joined, Odyssey was still in its infancy, with low adoption and several fundamental hurdles:

- It was completely **custom-built**, creating a steep learning curve for both adopters and contributors.
- The **documentation site** was also custom, making it difficult for the small team to maintain alongside other responsibilities.
- The guidelines were **rigid**, making it challenging to integrate Odyssey into existing workstreams without starting from scratch.
- A **lack of visibility** led to the perception that Odyssey was a "black box"—opaque and difficult to navigate.

These factors combined to make Odyssey feel like a treadmill — constantly moving but never truly progressing.

The solution required more than just new components; it necessitated a fundamental shift in how Odyssey was built, positioned, and maintained.

## Pivoting to MUI

One of my most impactful contributions at Okta was advocating for a fundamental architectural shift in Odyssey. I proposed moving away from a fully custom-built approach in favor of leveraging an open-source framework as its foundation.

This shift offered several key advantages:

- **Familiarity.** Leveraging an existing framework would make hiring easier and lower the adoption barrier for teams already familiar with it.
- **Efficiency.** By utilizing pre-built UI primitives, we could focus on developing patterns and templates specific to Okta rather than reinventing basic components.
- **Scalability.** Adopting an open-source framework meant benefiting from external contributions and industry-wide battle-testing, multiplying the impact of our relatively small team.
- **Incremental adoption.** Teams could fall back on the framework’s native components when Odyssey didn’t yet offer a solution.

After thorough research, I recommended rebuilding Odyssey on MUI. I formalized my proposal and secured buy-in from design, engineering, and product leadership.

This pivot significantly accelerated development velocity and reshaped how teams perceived Odyssey—not as a blocker, but as an enabler. The adoption curve shifted from reluctance to enthusiasm, with teams actively seeking out Odyssey components for their projects.

## Design, code, and process

As the team expanded in both size and effectiveness, I transitioned into a senior IC role, advancing from Staff Product Designer to Principal Product Designer.

I remained deeply engaged in execution, ensuring production-ready components were built with scalability and longevity in mind:

- Developed **React components** in TypeScript and Emotion, balancing flexibility with consistency.
- Prioritized **accessibility compliance** (WCAG 2.2), **internationalization**, and **RTL support**, embedding them into every component from the start.
- Designed and implemented a powerful **DataView component**, enabling teams to present and manipulate data as tables, lists, or grids through a unified API.
- Led efforts to introduce **theming** and **customization** support, giving product teams the ability to tailor the design system while maintaining cohesion.
- Defined a **contribution model**, empowering teams to enhance and extend the system rather than working around it.

However, technical improvements alone weren’t enough — **culture and process** were just as crucial. I drove several initiatives to improve documentation, workflows, and rituals that reinforced adoption:

- Rewrote **documentation** to be more developer-friendly, with clear code examples and integration guides.
- Established a **versioning system** to align component updates with broader release cycles.
- Enhanced **Storybook** to showcase real-world usage scenarios, easing adoption.
- Supported **office hours** and direct collaboration sessions to support teams in integrating Odyssey effectively.
- Suggested a **decision log** for greater transparency and clarity around changes.
- Helped manage a **dedicated Slack channel** for quick, accessible support.

These efforts transformed Odyssey into something teams wanted to use, rather than something they had to use. Feature teams began proactively engaging, providing feedback, and making meaningful contributions.

## Beyond Odyssey

Beyond my work on Odyssey, I also:

- Co-led an **AI working group**, defining design principles for AI integration.
- Co-founded an **internal education program** to help designers understand Okta’s full product ecosystem—later expanded company-wide.
- Served as design owner for **globalization**.

Additionally, I participated in multiple hackathons, contributing in a front-end engineering capacity.

## Building systems that last

Odyssey’s success wasn’t just about technology — it was the result of technical execution, strategic thinking, and cultural change. Scaling design effectively in any organization requires aligning with real designer and developer needs, creating systems that evolve over time, and making adoption seamless.

The key lesson? A design system isn’t just a collection of components — it’s an ecosystem that must be nurtured, evolved, and deeply integrated into an organization’s workflows. By blending deep technical expertise with a strong sense of empathy, I helped transform Odyssey from a little-used experiment into a fundamental part of Okta’s design and front-end engineering ecosystem.
