These are examples of the visual side of my work as a product designer. Some of these are mockups straight from Figma or Sketch, while others are images of shipped work in cases where I was also responsible for the implementation in code.

## Enterprise & business

I was the lead designer for Spoke, an enterprise ticketing platform. Among other features, I designed the workflow builder, which allows admins to create complex automations for events:

</figure>

<figure>
    <img src="{{ '/assets/img/work/spoke-workflow-logic.png' | absolute_url }}" alt="Spoke platform workflow logic interface">
</figure>

At Okta, I worked on design for the data table component and the associated filtering mechanism, and implemented both in React/TypeScript. You can see the [live version here](https://odyssey-storybook.okta.design/?path=/story/labs-components-dataview--everything); all the code for this is my own.

</figure>

I led design at Agrilyst, a management platform for indoor farms that uses a data-rich approach to help farms grow more efficiently. Among other features, I designed the dashboard, a single pane of glass for understanding the status of a farm at a glance.

</figure>

I also designed and built the reports feature, which enabled users to customize and save various widget layouts:

  <img src="{{ '/assets/img/work/agrilyst-reports.png' | absolute_url }}" alt="Agrilyst reports feature interface">
</figure>

I also designed the growth cycles feature, which allows users to track the lifecycle of a crop from seed to harvest (in many ways, similar to the workflow builder in Spoke that I worked on years later):

</figure>

## Consumer

I designed and built ConnectHV, an online community platform for the Hudson Valley's creative scene. You can see the [live site here](https://connecthv.com).

<figure>
    <img src="{{ '/assets/img/work/connecthv-v4-home.jpg' | absolute_url }}" alt="ConnectHV home page with activity feed">
</figure>

<figure>
    <img src="{{ '/assets/img/work/connecthv-v4-profile.jpg' | absolute_url }}" alt="ConnectHV user profile page">
</figure>

This was an earlier concept for a Destination page:

<figure>
    <img src="{{ '/assets/img/work/connecthv-v1-destination-v1.png' | absolute_url }}" alt="ConnectHV Destination page concept version one">
</figure>

I led design for Dwell, a consumer audio app that allows users to listen to various translations of the Bible. A key focus of the app was accessibility, and I worked to ensure that the app worked intuitively with VoiceOver enabled:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/img/writing/dwell-player-voiceover.jpg' | absolute_url }}" alt="Dwell player with VoiceOver inactive and active">
  <figcaption>On the left, the Dwell player with VoiceOver off. On the right, VoiceOver is on, revealing two additional buttons.</figcaption>
</figure>

I took cues from popular podcast and audiobook apps, such as Overcast, when figuring out how to surface power-user functionality such as speed and multi-track volume controls:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/img/writing/dwell-player-settings.gif' | absolute_url }}" alt="Dwell player settings interface">
</figure>

Strangely, this Dribbble shot of the Dwell onboarding flow is quoted as prior art in a [Samsung patent](https://patents.justia.com/patent/D960929). Go figure!

## Details

I care deeply about the tiny details, particularly microinteractions and motion.
